# Whats here

other than `monacoSearch` other files are from https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/385412e89f610aaa5dc7d6a3727f45e048e37c7e/src/vs/editor/contrib/find/common:

We don't actually us any of these files. These are just brought in for type checking against monaco.

* `findDecorations` : as is with minor changes
* `findState` : as is with minor changes
