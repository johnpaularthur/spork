# TypeScript features

As we mentioned the editor design revolves around giving you the best access to the TypeScript language service.

# Syntax Highlighting
Not just another text mate based grammar which [despite a lot of love](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/blob/ab17d24fed148cd789fd632d74f170c7308d75ff/TypeScriptReact.tmLanguage) can still fall short. Compare:

### Us

This is because *we use the exact same code that TypeScript uses to carry out its blazing fast compile*. Also we give all the more love that we can.

# Rename Refactoring
Start a rename refactoring and we show you an easy to view list of things that will change.

And if its a local change we will even allow you to do it inline.

# Matching
Matching tags and brackets and words are highlighted automatically, this means less searching, more doing

# Doctor
All the joys of inline information without the frustrations of keyboard shortcut, shifting text or dialog overloads. Toggle : `Ctrl|⌘ + '`

# Goto Definition

Easy as `Ctrl|⌘ + B`

# Find References

Easy as `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + B`

# Sync

If anything goes bad with our error analysis (it shouldn't but edge cases happen!), you can do a `sync` command (`Shift + F6`).

With `sync` we do:
* Tsconfig re-evaluation
* Complete refresh of Error analysis
