# Tree View
The tree view is designed to be as keyboard friendly as the rest of the application.

## Basic

* Toggle: `Ctrl|⌘ + \`. Opening the tree view automatically focuses you to it.
* Reveal Active File: `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + \`
* Focus: `Ctrl|⌘ + 0`. If its not open we open it

## Advanced

Beyond that the normal stuff you expect like arrow keys, `Enter` etc should just work. There are lot of other things the tree view provides but instead of listing them here, note that you can get to these by just tapping `H` when the tree view is in focus:
