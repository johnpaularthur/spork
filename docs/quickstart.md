# Requirements
* Latest Chrome
* Latest NodeJS

# Installation

Installation is super easy:

```bash
npm i spork -g
```

> TIP on mac / linux you might want to try `sudo npm i spork -g`.

# TypeScript Project
TypeScript projects are specified using a `tsconfig.json` file. If you don't have one we can create it for you just run

```bash
spork -i
```

# Start

Once you have the `tsconfig.json` (or if you already had one) you can start the editor using the following command from the directory that contains the project:

```bash
spork -o
```
> TIPs:
* `-p` flag can be used to provide a different path to `tsconfig.json`
* `-o` opens the browser window for you. Alternatively you can open the url that is logged on the console manually (something like http://localhost:4444)

# Using the editor

> One of the key goals of this editor is to make everything possible with just the keyboard.

Once you have the editor open you will be presented with a window like the following:

Now go ahead and open the [tree view][tree-view] with `Ctrl|âŒ˜ + \`

> **TIP** Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl|âŒ˜` means `Ctrl` on windows and `âŒ˜` on Mac.

The tree view has quite a few features (you can press `h` to view its help when it is in focus) and one of them is (no surprise ðŸŽ‰) **Add File**. Just tap `a` and you will be presented with a file add dialog.

Just type in the filename and press *enter*. This will create the file and open it for you as shown.

> TIP: `Ctrl|âŒ˜ + \` will toggle the tree view open and close

Now go ahead and type in some code. Doesn't have to be good code. Here is some bad code:

```ts
var foo = 123;
foo = 'Hello World'
console.log(foo);
```

You will notice that the TypeScript code intelligence / analysis will kick in. You can toggle the [error panel][errors] with `Ctrl|âŒ˜ + ;` (just giving you a reason to type the `;` key)

> TIP: You can cycle through project wide errors with `F8`. Remember we love the keyboard ðŸŽ¹

I leave it to you to fix the error, or leave it as it is and move to your real world application.
