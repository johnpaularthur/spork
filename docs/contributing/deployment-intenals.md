### *Deployment automation internals* ðŸŒ¹

We have an npm `postversion` script setup to run `git push --follow-tags` which pushes the npm version stuff to github. Then we have travis to automatically deploy **tagged commits** to NPM if tests succeed.

*How travis was setup*

* Add a .travis.yml file
* Toggle switch on travis using https://travis-ci.org/
* NPM deploy setup by simply running `travis setup npm` (you get `travis` from `gem install travis`). Then setup the API key using https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8970#issuecomment-122854271
* `all_branches` in `.travis.yml` is set to `true` because of https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1675#issuecomment-37851765
